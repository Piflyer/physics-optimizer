# Physics Optimizer
Attempting to use Scipy minimize to optimize the time steps for simple harmonic motion. The problem is with linear time steps, the calculated position of an object tends to increase in amplitude, instead of resemebling a cosine wave. First jab at this, feedback/contributions are welcomed.
